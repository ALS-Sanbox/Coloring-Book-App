This is a basic coloring app that will load a svg in the center and has a swatch at the top to choose colors.
The basic swatch themes are Base, Pastels, GreyScale, Regals, Brights, Subtles, and Alphabet.

Work in progress
1. Fills along with fills preview WIP: can fill the image with the pattern still working on getting color change working
2. A menu to allow for saving and loading images
